## User Stories
#

- As the user, I want to be able to keep track of all of my skydives digitally so I can ditch my paper logbook.

- As a follower/fellow skydiver, I want to be able to view someone else's logbook to learn more about their skill level, interests, and gear information to make informed and safe skydiving plans.

## Unsolved Problems / Major Hurdles
#

*Hurdles*
- **Mongoose Relationships**: Implementing a relationship between my two schemas was a hurdle. This was more difficult and time consuming than I anticipated but was able to get it working in the end. 
- **Additional Features**: Due to limited time and resources, I wasn't able to implement as many stretch goals listed below. I hope to revisit these later on. 

*Unresolved Stretch Goals* 
- Multer image upload 
- Logbook filter and sorting functionality 
    - Allow user to select sorting criteria 
    - Filter logbook data results to only show certain types of jump documents
